A Java version of the SDK that wraps the REST API for applications in Itslearning. It also contains a sample application to get Java developers started.

You can either:
  * Download the library zip files found on the betawww.islearning.com Developer site and have a look at the "MyFirstLearningTool" webapplication. Remember that you need both libraries, since LearningToolApp is dependent on the common library
or
  * Checkout the entire sourcecode in /trunk if you want to build it yourself. This will give you the latest version, and you can also build it yourself instead of using the prepackaged jar files
